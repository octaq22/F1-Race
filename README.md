# F1 Race

The F1 Race application is a Java-based program that simulates a Formula 1 race. It provides a graphical interface where users can observe cars racing on a track, complete with a semaphore indicating the start of the race. The application incorporates sound effects to enhance the racing experience and offers dynamic updates as the race progresses.

## Key Features

- **Graphical Interface**: The application provides a visually appealing interface where users can observe cars racing on a track. Cars are represented by graphical icons moving horizontally to simulate movement.

- **Semaphore Control**: A semaphore is used to signal the start of the race. Users can observe the semaphore changing colors, indicating the status of the race (red for stop, yellow for prepare, green for go).

- **Sound Effects**: Sound effects are integrated into the application to provide auditory feedback to users. The sounds include the starting signal and background race ambiance.

- **Dynamic Updates**: As the race progresses, the application dynamically updates the positions of the cars on the track, providing a real-time racing experience.

- **Race Completion**: Upon completion of the race, the application displays a message indicating the winning car, enhancing user engagement and providing closure to the racing experience.

## Usage

1. **Starting the Race**: Launch the application to start the race simulation. Observe the graphical interface to view cars racing on the track.

2. **Semaphore Control**: Pay attention to the semaphore to understand the status of the race. Green indicates the race has started, while red indicates it has stopped.

3. **Sound Effects**: Listen to the sound effects integrated into the application, including the starting signal and background race ambiance.

4. **Race Progression**: Watch as the cars move dynamically on the track, providing a realistic racing experience. Track the progress of each car as it moves towards the finish line.

5. **Race Completion**: After the race ends, observe the message displayed by the application indicating the winning car. Reflect on the race experience and enjoy the conclusion.

## Technologies Used

- Java
- Java Swing (for the graphical user interface)
- AudioSystem and Clip (for sound effects)
- Threading (for simulating multiple cars racing simultaneously)
